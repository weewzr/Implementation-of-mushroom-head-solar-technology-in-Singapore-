# Persistent Project Pass Counter

**Purpose:** make the mandatory audit cadence survive new ChatGPT sessions. This file is a project-control state record, not technical evidence.

## Current state

- Total explicit user `Continue` commands counted through 27 September 2026: **174**.
- Most recent mandatory audit: `docs/audits/2026-09-27_three-pass_audit-56.md`.
- That audit occurred on Continue #172.
- Passes since most recent audit: **2**.
- Audit 50 at Continue #154 correctly withheld release pending the completed canonical consumer refactor. Continue #155 reconciled stale governance state against post-audit evidence: commit `53d7d3420202ea81bf5b0a8d40b1ee87a93a68c4`, Rust run `36240614922` PASS, e2e run `36240614938` PASS, artifact `10905852093` SHA-256 `e450ccd79f303bd1a701293dbbc5613f156520c122a92ccbb6229b08e2eaf110`. Fresh artifact inspection closes exact-resource, convergence, crossover, sensitivity and stability gates; Markdown/LaTeX/traceability parity is synchronized. **Paraboloid geometric-response result is FROZEN DEVELOPMENT_NOT_SERIS and the fixed-geometry equal-resource comparison phase is authorized.** Continue #156 implemented `src/fixed_geometry.rs` and geometry-agnostic `src/annual_irradiance.rs`; candidate topology now feeds canonical resource normalization and shared visibility/sky/annual evaluation contracts. Audit 51 found framework runs `36288726695` and `36288726639` fail compilation because the shared annual evaluator had an ambiguous `sum()` type. Commit `f6e46aafc0c799ba69274faffec725abc9340d96` corrects the compile defect. Continue #158 inspected post-compile-fix runs `36289462888`/`36289462848`: compilation succeeds and 67/68 framework/library tests pass; the sole failure is the hemisphere analytical area-ratio tolerance at the intermediate mesh. Commit `adde4deec12cdc5e44cc340ac59ea7edf9f9080a` strengthens this to monotone multi-resolution convergence plus a refined analytical tolerance. Audit 52 at Continue #160 confirms whole-crate run `36290127196` PASS and e2e run `36290127283` PASS at `adde4deec12cdc5e44cc340ac59ea7edf9f9080a`. E2E artifact `10922505206` SHA-256 `5cb924eaaa8d69afd4b3852eb7f3c6e304735b527d30cadd245910feb2c84e6e`; Rust artifact `10921797900` SHA-256 `be82d75632c40b4deea0867fc5a61f4c84f79a143e4951529bffcb359f804ae6`. **The common fixed-geometry comparison framework is FROZEN and controlled matched-resource annual candidate-comparison execution is authorized for the next session. No comparison/ranking has yet been executed or promoted.**

## Session state

- Current ChatGPT session explicit `Continue` count: **2**.
- Persisted technical/audit state was recovered from the master source, this counter, the audit ledger, Audit 46, Audit 47 and repository history before substantive work.
- Session rotation required: **no — new session resumed from persisted post-Audit-56 state; 2/12 Continues used.**
- Next-pass state: **Continue #174 / Pass 2 of Audit Cycle 57 / new-session Continue 2/12. Comparison descendant 36322665077 is PASS at 311fc2c779a081c8b9da67ab2efa166369e37bdf with artifact 10933201362 SHA-256 5de0c89b7283d3b815d0b72d2dd05c5844e91fb54efeb8f38b5b18666a974b0e, but direct artifact inspection shows the retained payload is the NASA POWER development-weather CSV rather than retained machine-readable comparison rows; comparison freeze therefore remains held. PDF portability compile closes narrowly: run 36323106291 PASS at 4ebbb8e3d2131a2247cb0786f960103aff2e97a1, artifact 10933346309 SHA-256 a2fd5190946215382741337be259c8f879175193a4f9f7e3250a710abddf09da. Actual 23-page render QA found material black-rectangle figure regressions from malformed SVG colour/hash attributes; nine SVGs were repaired through ca0fc6651a65baeff947a2f92299cd0502211cf3. Fresh corrected PDF artifact and full reinspection remain required. Evidence note: docs/audits/2026-09-27_continue-174-evidence.md. Accordion/fan remains not started. If no earlier major-result release occurs, Continue #175 is mandatory Audit 57.**

## Session-rotation rule

- Maximum explicit `Continue` commands per ChatGPT session: **12**.
- A new session resets only the per-session counter; total project count, audit cadence, technical state and unresolved deficiencies persist.
- On the 12th Continue, complete any due audit/state recording but do not begin another substantive pass in that session.

## New-session bootstrap rule

At the first substantive project turn in every new session:
1. Consult the Project Source `MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS_MUSHROOM_HEAD_SOLAR`.
2. Read `docs/audits/PASS_COUNTER.md` and `docs/audits/AUDIT_LEDGER.md` before doing substantive work.
3. Treat every explicit user message `Continue` as one project pass.
4. Update this file on every explicit `Continue`, not only on audit turns.
5. If `passes since most recent audit` becomes 3, perform the master-instruction audit before substantive work, record it in `AUDIT_LEDGER.md`, then reset the counter to 0.
6. Audit earlier when a major model layer, numerical result, optimisation result, design conclusion or milestone is introduced.
7. If this state file is missing, inconsistent, or stale, do not guess the cadence. Reconstruct it from the audit ledger/project history or perform an audit conservatively before expansion.

## Scope clarification

The counter tracks explicit `Continue` commands because the user requested that a `Continue` count as a project pass. Other substantive user turns may still trigger an early audit when required by the master instruction.
